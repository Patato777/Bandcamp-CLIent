# Bandcamp-CLIent
A work-in-progress command-line client for Bandcamp (bandcamp.com), with a curses interface.

src/old contains an old, deprecated and unfinished version, that I'm rewriting from zero. New version (also unfinished, but still in dev) in src/bc_client

License: no license yet, for my code, use it as you want without commercial intent. I do not own code from bandcamp.com, additional rules apply.
